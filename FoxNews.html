    <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced Wednesday that it will officially retire the Aviation Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) on May 1, following a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) report that identified over $42 million in wasteful spending related to the aging system.</p>

    <p>ALMIS, which has been in use since the early 2000s, was originally designed to track aircraft maintenance cycles and performance. However, recent audits revealed that the system overinflated maintenance metrics by 23% due to outdated code that has not been updated since its inception.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "When a system is no longer doing what it's built for, and it's costing tens of millions to maintain, it's time to move forward—even if that means stepping back for a moment," said Rear Admiral Marcus Weller, Assistant Commandant for Engineering and Logistics.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "We’ve known ALMIS was falling short for years, but no one wanted to be the one to pull the plug," said a senior Coast Guard logistics officer who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the decision.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "There are serious concerns about how this will impact readiness, especially without a solid backup in place. But the directive was clear: shut it down," said another high-ranking official with direct knowledge of the decision.
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Coast Guard has confirmed that there is currently no replacement system in place for ALMIS, raising concerns from internal staff and external analysts alike. In the interim, the service will return to using paper logbooks to track maintenance and logistics until an updated digital tracking system has been identified and approved for use. The article also confirmed that the Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CGLIMS), another legacy platform, will also be taken offline on May 1.</p>

    <p>While DOGE highlighted the need to modernize Coast Guard operations, the sudden decommissioning of both systems without a transitional plan has led some to question the impact on aviation readiness and supply chain tracking.</p>

    <p>"This isn’t about eliminating capabilities; it’s about eliminating waste," Weller added. "But we acknowledge the gap this will create, and we are working to identify interim solutions."
    </p>

    <p>ALMIS and CGLIMS will both go dark on May 1 as the Coast Guard evaluates long-term digital modernization strategies.</p>
